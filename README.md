This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Going live with IDX listings (Repliers)

Listings are served through a provider abstraction (`src/lib/idx/`). The app
calls `getListings()` / `getListing()` and never knows which backend answers;
the backend is chosen by the `IDX_PROVIDER` env var and defaults to built-in
**sample data** so the UI is fully functional before a live feed is connected.

To switch the live site over to the real Repliers MLS feed, set two environment
variables in **Vercel → Project → Settings → Environment Variables** (they are
secrets — never commit them):

| Variable | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `IDX_PROVIDER` | `repliers` |
| `REPLIERS_API_KEY` | your Repliers API key (start with the sandbox key, then the production key) |

Then redeploy. That's the whole switch — no code change. Listing pages
(`/listings`, `/listings/[id]`) render on demand and cache each Repliers
response for 15 minutes (`revalidate: 900`), so new/updated MLS listings appear
within ~15 minutes without a rebuild.

Before go-live, confirm two things against a **real Repliers sandbox response**:

1. **Field names.** `src/lib/idx/repliers.ts` maps Repliers' documented shape,
   but a few keys/enumerations vary by MLS. Fetch one live listing and verify
   price, beds/baths, sqft, photos, and status map correctly.
2. **IDX compliance text.** Replace the placeholder disclaimer in
   `src/components/IdxDisclaimer.tsx` with GLVAR's exact required IDX
   attribution/disclaimer wording.

Live listings are automatically cross-linked to the matching community page
when their subdivision/neighborhood matches one of our communities
(`matchCommunitySlug` in `src/content/communities.ts`).

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.
